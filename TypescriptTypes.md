# TypeScript

## Why TS?

TypeScript allows us to assign types to variables, functions, and basically everything in our JS codebases. This seems like overhead work but actually enables to take advantage of type checking and static code analysis to ensure our code is secure before pushing it out to our end users.

We don't actually run TS, rather TS lets us compile to JS and performs all these checks during the compilation step.

## Some Killer Resources on TS

### TypeScript Handbook

The go to for learning about TS basics or even advanced concepts is the [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) which is written directly by the authors of TS.

### TypeScript Deep Dive

If you're feeling crazy ðŸ¤ª, the [TypeScript Deep Dive](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/) is your go-to-guide on becoming a TypeScript pro. I (Hayden) have read this end-to-end and it turned me from a meh JS dev to a TS pro.
